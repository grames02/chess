## What Was Accomplished Today

Right now, I'm going back through my code and I'm going to start planning how I want to do the Chess project. I don't want to just jump into it and then get confused. I've already done the setup and watched the video. Now I have to do the rest of the Chess logistics. I also am trying to better become acustumed with Git. I'm not the best at commiting directly from the terminal, and need to better understand it. Hopefully I can improve on that throughout the class. Right now, I prefer to just edit it inside of the Git website itself, but I know that's not the most ideal method.

Alrighty, I've been looking at the code for a couple of hours now. I'm still not done, but I'm starting to understand it better. I started making a piece movement calculator class (as suggested by one of the videos.) I'm also more familiar with the code and structure of the game (how lowercase pieces are black, etc.) I'll resume tomorrow.

## What Was Accomplished Today

Alrighty, I went ahead and got my slack account all configured. I feel like last time was good for better understanding the code itself. This time, I'm hoping to get some of it actually done. I went ahead and asked in Slack for clarification on the assignment requirements as well.

I've been working on the 'Chess Board' file. It's been pretty interesting. I've mainly constructed the reset board function. I thought I had done it correctly, however I keep getting errors that I'm out of Range. So now I'm revisiting the instructions and am trying to see where I'm going wrong. I most likely could've been more efficient with how I setup the board, but I think it'll work nonetheless. Just gotta find where the bugs are.

## What Was Accomplished

Awesome!! I went on a late night coding grind and tried to figure out why my resetboard wasn't working. I went onto Slack and saw people talking about the Hashing and Equals overrides. These were my issue! I also had the board off by one and had to implement a minus 1 into my add and get location (since they're using 0 as 1.) Anyways, I watched the video explaining how hashing and equals all worked. Interesting how it provides the address and not the actual content. It took me a little while to fully understand this, but then I went back and implemented all the steps and everything is passing!

The only thing that I have left is the pieces and how they individually move. I'm following the class advice and making a piece calculator file, which I can referrence. I might work on it for a bit longer. We'll see if I get any breakthroughs.

Alrighty, it's a little past 1 AM and I'm calling it. I didn't make any of the piece movement patterns yet. However, I have setup where they will be implemented and essentially made a skeleton of my ChessPieceCalculator code. I'll wrap it up in the morning.
