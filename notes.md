## What Was Accomplished Today

Right now, I'm going back through my code and I'm going to start planning how I want to do the Chess project. I don't want to just jump into it and then get confused. I've already done the setup and watched the video. Now I have to do the rest of the Chess logistics. I also am trying to better become acustumed with Git. I'm not the best at commiting directly from the terminal, and need to better understand it. Hopefully I can improve on that throughout the class. Right now, I prefer to just edit it inside of the Git website itself, but I know that's not the most ideal method.

Alrighty, I've been looking at the code for a couple of hours now. I'm still not done, but I'm starting to understand it better. I started making a piece movement calculator class (as suggested by one of the videos.) I'm also more familiar with the code and structure of the game (how lowercase pieces are black, etc.) I'll resume tomorrow.

## What Was Accomplished Today

Alrighty, I went ahead and got my slack account all configured. I feel like last time was good for better understanding the code itself. This time, I'm hoping to get some of it actually done. I went ahead and asked in Slack for clarification on the assignment requirements as well.
