This file is just for my notes and general thoughts while developing Chess.

Ok, so first of all, I want to review the code I've already seen and ensure that I better understand it all.

ChessBoard.java
-This file is for: the board itself. It initializes the game with the proper board size. It also has the function
for adding a piece and getting its location.

ChessGame.java
-This file is for: The game itself. A good chunk of the rules, which team is which, stalemate stuff, etc.

ChessMove.java
-This file is for: The chess pieces moving across the board. It also has the upgrade system for the pawn.

ChessPiece.java
-This file is for: All the individual pieces and their movesets

ChessPosition.java
-This file is for: Helpful function for telling us where the pieces are at.

Ok. So now I've reviewed some of the files. Let's think on how these can work together.

I've been messing around with it, and I have some initial questions.

1. How do we know what piece has been selected for a move?

Alrighty, so my next course of action is to fix the reset board function. Once this is done, I can start doing the individual pieces.
I also should make an out of bounds function. I think having one could prove helpful for the project.
